# TORRE

## TCloudG Test for Torre.

This uses the opportunities endpoint (POST https://search.torre.co/opportunities/_search/?[offset=$offset&size=$size&aggregate=$aggregate]) and shows the information in a simple way without styles as 24 hours to do this it's too little time, I uploaded the built version over http://tcloudg.com so you can test it, I did a basic portal with the opportunities and a fake signal link. In order to test it just go to tcloudg.com and click on Torre Test side menu link to fetch data from the provide REST endpoint.

This frontend was build in Angular 9.
